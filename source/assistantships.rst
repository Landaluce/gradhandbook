Assistantships
===========================

Teaching Assistantships
---------------------------

Each year the Computer Science department offers a small number of graduate assistantships for new and continuing students. Assistantships target students with exceptional computing background, regardless of which degree you are pursuing.

For new students who receive an assistantship, it is customary to make a full academic year commitment, which is 
renewable for up to two additional semesters.

You should therefore assume that assistantships are competitive. 





Funding for Advanced Students
--------------------------------

Students who have completed course work, passed the PhD exam, and received approval of their dissertation proposals are eligible to apply for the Arthur J. Schmitt Dissertation Fellowships. The award, which is not renewable, requires no service. Advanced students are also eligible to apply for a very limited number of Teaching Scholars Awards, whose service requirements include the teaching of three courses, and Advanced Fellowships with no teaching responsibilities.
