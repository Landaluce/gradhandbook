Assistantships

Teaching Assistantships
---------------------------

Each year the Department of English offers a number of Graduate Assistantships for new and continuing students. Unlike many other universities, however, Loyola concentrates on developing assistants’ skills before allowing them to assume sole responsibility for a composition course. Rather than being immediately assigned to teach a class during their first semester of graduate school, assistants first gain experience tutoring undergraduates in the Writing Center. First semester they tutor for two shifts. During their second semester, assistants work with a faculty member in a Mentorship Program that allows them to assume some grading and instructional duties within the mentor’s composition class, and tutor for one shift.

In the second year (or first year post-MA), assistants teach one composition course each semester, receiving informal support and guidance from the mentor of the previous year. In the third, fourth and fifth years, assistants normally work as teaching assistants in a literature course, teach one literature course each per term, or serve as research assistants for one semester. In addition, one student each year is assigned as the assistant director of the Writing Center. Graduate instructors never teach more than one class per term.

Policy on “floaters”

All third, fourth, and fifth-year graduate assistants who are not serving as instructors-of-record also serve as “floaters.” Floaters take courses for faculty who must miss a class because of illness, jury duty, professional conferences, or other University-sanctioned events. Students serving as floaters in a given semester cannot turn down a request to take a faculty member’s class unless they are in class themselves. In turn, the department makes every effort to distribute the workload equitably among the floaters in any one semester. 

Because floaters are not necessarily trained in the content area of the faculty member’s course, faculty members devise assignments with this in mind. Floaters may show a film, conduct a writing workshop, hand back and discuss papers, or teach a poem, essay or story that they already know or can prepare with minimum effort and much advanced notice. The faculty member should provide detailed notes for what he/she expects to be covered in class that day. 

Graduate Assistantships are renewable for a total of five years of support, if the students remain in good standing and are making good progress toward the degree. After that, students can apply through the Department for a range of fellowship opportunities made available by the Graduate School (see below).

Funding for Advanced Students
--------------------------------

Students who have completed course work, passed the PhD exam, and received approval of their dissertation proposals are eligible to apply for the Arthur J. Schmitt Dissertation Fellowships. The award, which is not renewable, requires no service. Advanced students are also eligible to apply for a very limited number of Teaching Scholars Awards, whose service requirements include the teaching of three courses, and Advanced Fellowships with no teaching responsibilities.
