Teaching Assistantships
===========================

Each year the Computer Science department offers a small number of graduate assistantships 
for new and continuing students. Assistantships target students with exceptional 
computing background, regardless of which degree you are pursuing.  
You should therefore assume that assistantships are competitive. 

For new students who receive an assistantship, it is customary to make a full academic 
year commitment, which is renewable for up to two additional semesters.
