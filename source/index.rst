Loyola University Chicago Computer Science - Graduate Handbook
==========================================================================================

This is a *draft* of the Graduate Handbook for students at Loyola University
Chicago. It is (a) not remotely ready and (b) not at all official.
This is for review purposes only (by the Graduate Program Committee and
the CS Department faculty). We will
announce its availability by late Spring 2013 (around April but possibly
earlier).
