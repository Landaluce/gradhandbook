Regulations and Procedures
================================

Course Loads
--------------------------------

A full-time student will usually carry three courses per semester, or, for Graduate Assistants entering the classroom as instructors, two courses and one teaching assignment. Course loads for part-time students are worked out on an individual basis. All students funded by the Department or the Graduate School are considered full time.

Registration
--------------------------------

Both new and continuing students must complete the process of registration before every semester in which they are either attending classes or writing their dissertations. A schedule of courses for the upcoming term is available a few months before classes are scheduled to begin. In order to register for graduate courses you must first consult with the Director of Graduate Programs. Once your selections are approved, they will be entered into the system by the Graduate Programs Secretary, completing the registration process. It is your responsibility to check LOCUS to verify your registration each semester. Students must maintain continual registration throughout their years in the program or risk having to apply for reinstatement and pay both a penalty and back fees.

Grades
--------------------------------

The grading system used in the Graduate School is as follows:

.. csv-table:: Grading System
   	:header: "Grade", "Grade Points"
   	:widths: 15, 15

   	"A",4.00
	"A–",3.67
	"B+",3.33
	"B",3.00
	"B–",2.67
	"C+",2.33
	"C",2.00

.. csv-table:: Other Grading Codes
   	:header: "Grade", "Explained"
   	:widths: 15, 15


	"I","Incomplete"
	"W","Withdrawal"
	"WF","Withdrawal, Failure"
	"CR","Credit"
	"NC","No Credit"
	"AU","Audit"

For further information on Loyola’s grading policy, consult the Graduate School Catalog.

Graduate students in the English Department are expected to maintain an average of not less than B (3.0). Those who fail to meet this requirement may be dismissed. No more than two grades below B and no grades of D or F may be counted as fulfilling degree requirements. PhD students who find themselves receiving primarily B’s (or below) should consider seriously whether pursuing a doctorate in English remains the most gainful use of their time.


Withdrawal
--------------------------------

Withdrawal from graduate courses is uncommon; however, students who do withdraw from a course must first consult with the Director of Graduate Programs before dropping through LOCUS. Students should check the academic calendar for deadlines on withdrawing for full or partial refunds, and with a W or F grade. Students are responsible for withdrawing themselves from classes.


Incompletes
--------------------------------

Faculty may assign the grade of I to a student who has not completed the assigned work by the end of the term. This grade is not assigned automatically; rather, it is up to the student to work out with the instructor a plan, including a deadline, for completing the work for the course.

	This doesn't look right. I think all of this is done in LOCUS now.

The Director of Graduate Programs must sign off on incompletes before they will be awarded.Students need to download the change-of-grade form from the Graduate School website and give it to the GPD when the incomplete is approved. 

Under the Graduate School regulations, a student has one semester to complete the course. If the student does not turn in the work by the deadline, the I will automatically become an F.  Please read the new policy on the Graduate School web page at http://www.luc.edu/gradschool/academics_policies.shtml#grades1.

Although it is not uncommon for graduate students to take an occasional Incomplete, it is of course better not to take an incomplete when possible. Making up an incomplete course often proves harder than students expect, particularly if much time has elapsed since the end of the course. In any case, faculty members have various policies regarding Incompletes, so it is advisable to discuss the matter with your instructor as early as possible if you anticipate the need for an Incomplete. You must also complete a form (available on our Web site at http:// www.luc.edu/english/links.shtml) and have it signed by the GPD. No more than one I can be requested in a semester, unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., a serious illness). 


Leaves of Absence
--------------------------------

Official leaves of absence are intended for students who wish to discontinue temporarily their graduate studies due to special circumstances (e.g., medical, personal, or professional reasons). A leave of absence postpones all deadlines concerning completion of degree requirements for the duration of the leave. A student requesting a leave must complete a Leave of Absence form and contact the Director of Graduate Programs, who then makes a recommendation on the student’s behalf to the Graduate School. Decisions regarding the approval of leaves of absence rest with the Graduate School.

Leaves of absence may be requested for a semester or for a full academic year. In order to be reinstated to active status, the student must notify the Graduate School in writing upon returning from a leave. Unless the student is granted a renewal of a leave, he or she must return to active status in the semester following its expiration. Failure to do so may result in withdrawal from the program.

The Leave of Absence form is found in the GPRS system.

Advanced Standing/Transfer Credits
----------------------------------------

It is ordinarily expected that all work for the Master’s degree will be completed at Loyola. Upon the recommendation of the Director of Graduate Programs, however, and with the approval of the Dean, up to six hours of credit for graduate work at another university may be counted toward the degree.


Academic Honesty
--------------------------------

Although academic dishonesty can take many forms, in our field it manifests primarily as plagiarism of text our source code. The Graduate School Catalog defines plagiarism as “the appropriation for gain of ideas, language or work of another without sufficient public acknowledgement that the material is not one’s own.” As a graduate student, you very likely have a good understanding of the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. If you are ever uncertain, it is of course best to consult the Director of Graduate Programs or another faculty member.

The penalty for an instance of plagiarism is, at a minimum, failure on the assignment, which may well be tantamount to failure in the course. A serious breach or a pattern of dishonesty can lead to expulsion from Loyola. Although quite rare in our department, cases have occurred in the past and have resulted in dismissal.


Grievance Procedure
----------------------------------

Students, faculty, and administrators are strongly encouraged to resolve any problems they encounter in the academic process through informal discussion. If you are unable to resolve a problem with a member of the staff or faculty, or if you wish to lodge a formal complaint, you should first meet to discuss the matter with the Director of Graduate Programs. If the problem cannot be satisfactorily resolved by the GPD, it will be taken up by the Department Chair. Violations of the University’s ethical standards not resolvable within the Department may call for the use of the Graduate School’s grievance procedure. Students wishing to initiate a grievance must do so in writing to the Dean. Further information can be obtained from the Graduate School office.
