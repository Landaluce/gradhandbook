Acknowledgments
======================

We wish to acknowledge the following for their contributions that made this possible.

- We actually started from the general structure of the English department's graduate studnet handbook.

- Dr. Harrington (past Graduate Program Director for Computer Science) put together some administrative resources that proved helpful for our department-specific policies/procedures section.
