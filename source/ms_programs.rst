MS IT

All of this needs to be written for CS.

MS Thesis Option
---------------------

A thesis is not required for the MA degree. Students may choose to write a thesis in lieu of taking two classes (6 credits), although course work is strongly recommended over the thesis option. Students wishing to do a thesis should discuss this option as early as possible with the Director of Graduate Programs. Regarding thesis procedures, see the Graduate School Catalog.


Time and Residence Requirements
------------------------------------------

Normally it takes one year of full-time study to earn a masterâ€™s degree in English from Loyola. Students who attend part time must complete the program within five years. This period may be extended only by special action of the Dean of the Graduate School.


Application for Degree
------------------------------------------

It is the exclusive responsibility of all graduate students to inform the Graduate School office of their intention to graduate with an MA degree. Once you have determined when you will receive your degree (e.g., August, December or May), you must apply for graduation through LOCUS. The Graduate School sets the deadlines (typically December 1 for a May degree, February 1 for an August degree, and August 1 for a December degree). Check the academic calendar for the Graduate School available through the main page of the Loyola website. 

After completing the summer courses and passing the exams, you'll be certified for an August degree. Because we have only one ceremony per year when students "walk," however, August degree students walk in the May ceremony the following year.
